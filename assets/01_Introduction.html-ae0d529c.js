This book introduces the algorithmic and mathematical tools that can be used to create all kinds of images—realistic visual effects, informative technical illustrations, or beautiful computer animations. Graphics can be two- or three-dimensional; images can be completely synthetic or can be produced by manipulating photographs. This book is about the fundamental algorithms and mathematics, especially those used to produce synthetic images of three-dimensional objects and scenes.</p><p>Actually doing computer graphics inevitably requires knowing about speciﬁc hardware, ﬁle formats, and usually a graphics API (see Section 1.3) or two. Computer graphics is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld, so the speciﬁcs of that knowledge are a moving target. Therefore, in this book we do our best to avoid depending on any speciﬁc hardware or API. Readers are encouraged to supplement the text with relevant documentation for their software and hardware environment. Fortunately, the culture of computer graphics has enough standard terminology and concepts that the discussion in this book should map nicely to most environments.</p><p>This chapter deﬁnes some basic terminology and provides some historical background, as well as information sources related to computer graphics.</p><h2 id="_1-1-graphics-areas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-1-graphics-areas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.1 Graphics Areas</h2><p>Imposing categories on any ﬁeld is dangerous, but most graphics practitioners would agree on the following major areas of computer graphics:</p><ul><li><strong>Modeling</strong> deals with the mathematical speciﬁcation of shape and appearance properties in a way that can be stored on the computer. For example, a coffee mug might be described as a set of ordered 3D points along with some interpolation rule to connect the points and a reﬂection model that describes how light interacts with the mug.</li><li><strong>Rendering</strong> is a term inherited from art and deals with the creation of shaded images from 3D computer models.</li><li><strong>Animation</strong> is a technique to create an illusion of motion through sequences of images. Animation uses modeling and rendering but adds the key issue of movement over time, which is not usually dealt with in basic modeling and rendering.</li></ul><p>There are many other areas that involve computer graphics, and whether they are core graphics areas is a matter of opinion. These will all be at least touched on in the text. Such related areas include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>User interaction</strong> deals with the interface between input devices such as mice and tablets, the application, feedback to the user in imagery, and other sensory feedback. Historically, this area is associated with graphics largely because graphics researchers had some of the earliest access to the input/output devices that are now ubiquitous.</li><li><strong>Virtual reality</strong> attempts to immerse the user into a 3D virtual world. This typically requires at least stereo graphics and response to head motion. For true virtual reality, sound and force feedback should be provided as well. Because this area requires advanced 3D graphics and advanced display technology, it is often closely associated with graphics.</li><li><strong>Visualization</strong> attempts to give users insight into complex information via visual display. Often there are graphic issues to be addressed in a visualization problem.</li><li><strong>Image processing</strong> deals with the manipulation of 2D images and is used in both the ﬁelds of graphics and vision.</li><li><strong>Three-dimensional scanning</strong> uses range-ﬁnding technology to create measured 3D models. Such models are useful for creating rich visual imagery, and the processing of such models often requires graphics algorithms.</li><li><strong>Computational photography</strong> is the use of computer graphics, computer vision, and image processing methods to enable new ways of photographically capturing objects, scenes, and environments.</li></ul><h2 id="_1-2-major-applications" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-2-major-applications" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.2 Major Applications</h2><p>Almost any endeavor can make some use of computer graphics, but the major consumers of computer graphics technology include the following industries:</p><ul><li><strong>Video games</strong> increasingly use sophisticated 3D models and rendering algorithms.</li><li><strong>Cartoons</strong> are often rendered directly from 3D models. Many traditional 2D cartoons use backgrounds rendered from 3D models, which allow a continuously moving viewpoint without huge amounts of artist time.</li><li><strong>Visual effects</strong> use almost all types of computer graphics technology. Almost every modern ﬁlm uses digital compositing to superimpose backgrounds with separately ﬁlmed foregrounds. Many ﬁlms also use 3D modeling and animation to create synthetic environments, objects, and even characters that most viewers will never suspect are not real.</li><li><strong>Animated ﬁlms</strong> use many of the same techniques that are used for visual effects, but without necessarily aiming for images that look real.</li><li><strong>CAD/CAM</strong> stands for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. These ﬁelds use computer technology to design parts and products on the computer and then, using these virtual designs, to guide the manufacturing process. For example, many mechanical parts are designed in a 3D computer modeling package and then automatically produced on a computer-controlled milling device.</li><li><strong>Simulation</strong> can be thought of as accurate video gaming. For example, a ﬂight simulator uses sophisticated 3D graphics to simulate the experience of ﬂying an airplane. Such simulations can be extremely useful for initial training in safety-critical domains such as driving, and for scenario training for experienced users such as speciﬁc ﬁre-ﬁghting situations that are too costly or dangerous to create physically.</li><li><strong>Medical imaging</strong> creates meaningful images of scanned patient data. For example, a computed tomography (CT) dataset is composed of a large 3D rectangular array of density values. Computer graphics is used to create shaded images that help doctors extract the most salient information from such data.</li><li><strong>Information visualization</strong> creates images of data that do not necessarily have a “natural” visual depiction. For example, the temporal trend of the price of ten different stocks does not have an obvious visual depiction, but clever graphing techniques can help humans see the patterns in such data.</li></ul><h2 id="_1-3-graphics-apis" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-3-graphics-apis" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.3 Graphics APIs</h2><p>A key part of using graphics libraries is dealing with a graphics API. An application program interface (API) is a standard collection of functions to perform a set of related operations, and a graphics API is a set of functions that perform basic operations such as drawing images and 3D surfaces into windows on the screen.</p><p>Every graphics program needs to be able to use two related APIs: a graphics API for visual output and a user-interface API to get input from the user. There are currently two dominant paradigms for graphics and user-interface APIs. The ﬁrst is the integrated approach, exempliﬁed by Java, where the graphics and user-interface toolkits are integrated and portable packages that are fully standardized and supported as part of the language. The second is represented by Direct3D and OpenGL, where the drawing commands are part of a software library tied to a language such as C++, and the user-interface software is an independent entity that might vary from system to system. In this latter approach, it is problematic to write portable code, although for simple programs it may be possible to use a portable library layer to encapsulate the system speciﬁc user-interface code.</p><p>Whatever your choice of API, the basic graphics calls will be largely the same, and the concepts of this book will apply.</p><h2 id="_1-4-graphics-pipeline" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-4-graphics-pipeline" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.4 Graphics Pipeline</h2><p>Every desktop computer today has a powerful 3D graphics pipeline. This is a special software/hardware subsystem that efﬁciently draws 3D primitives in perspective. Usually these systems are optimized for processing 3D triangles with shared vertices. The basic operations in the pipeline map the 3D vertex locations to 2D screen positions and shade the triangles so that they both look realistic and appear in proper back-to-front order.</p><p>Although drawing the triangles in valid back-to-front order was once the most important research issue in computer graphics, it is now almost always solved using the z-buffer, which uses a special memory buffer to solve the problem in a brute-force manner.</p>',19),r=a("p",null,[s("It turns out that the geometric manipulation used in the graphics pipeline can be accomplished almost entirely in a 4D coordinate space composed of three traditional geometric coordinates and a fourth homogeneous coordinate that helps with perspective viewing.

Efﬁciency is achieved through careful tradeoffs, and these tradeoffs are different for different architectures. However, for the foreseeable future, a good heuristic is that programmers should pay more attention to memory access patterns than to operation counts. This is the opposite of the best heuristic of two decades ago. This switch has occurred because the speed of memory has not kept pace with the speed of processors. Since that trend continues, the importance of limited and coherent memory access for optimization should only increase.</p><p>A reasonable approach to making code fast is to proceed in the following order, taking only those steps which are needed:</p><ol><li>Write the code in the most straightforward way possible. Compute intermediate results as needed on the ﬂy rather than storing them.</li><li>Compile in optimized mode.</li><li>Use whatever proﬁling tools exist to ﬁnd critical bottlenecks.</li><li>Examine data structures to look for ways to improve locality. If possible, make data unit sizes match the cache/page size on the target architecture.</li><li>If proﬁling reveals bottlenecks in numeric computations, examine the assembly code generated by the compiler for missed efﬁciencies. Rewrite source code to solve any problems you ﬁnd.</li></ol><p>The most important of these steps is the ﬁrst one. Most “optimizations” make the code harder to read without speeding things up. In addition, time spent upfront optimizing code is usually better spent correcting bugs or adding features. Also, beware of suggestions from old texts; some classic tricks such as using integers instead of reals may no longer yield speed because modern CPUs can usually perform ﬂoating-point operations just as fast as they perform integer operations. In all situations, proﬁling is needed to be sure of the merit of any optimization for a speciﬁc machine and compiler.</p><h2 id="_1-7-designing-and-coding-graphics-programs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-7-designing-and-coding-graphics-programs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.7 Designing and Coding Graphics Programs</h2><p>Certain common strategies are often useful in graphics programming.

These routines should be made as clean and efﬁcient as possible. A universal design question is whether locations and displacements should be separate classes because they have different operations, e.g., a location multiplied by one-half makes no geometric sense while one-half of a displacement does (Goldman, 1985; DeRose, 1989). There is little agreement on this question, which can spur hours of heated debate among graphics practitioners, but for the sake of example let’s assume we will not make the distinction.</p><p>This implies that some basic classes to be written include:</p>',10),B=a("ul",null,[a("li",null,[a("strong",null,"vector2."),s(" A 2D vector class that stores an x- and y-component.

One reason for this is that using such debuggers is more awkward for complex programs than for simple programs. Another reason is that the most difﬁcult errors are conceptual ones where the wrong thing is being implemented, and it is easy to waste large amounts of time stepping through variable values without detecting such cases. We have found several debugging strategies to be particularly useful in graphics.</p><p><strong>The Scientiﬁc Method</strong></p><p>In graphics programs there is an alternative to traditional debugging that is often very useful. The downside to it is that it is very similar to what computer programmers are taught not to do early in their careers, so you may feel “naughty” if you do it: we create an image and observe what is wrong with it. Then, we develop a hypothesis about what is causing the problem and test it. For example, in a ray-tracing program we might have many somewhat random looking dark pixels. This is the classic “shadow acne” problem that most people run into when they write a ray tracer. Traditional debugging is not helpful here; instead, we must realize that the shadow rays are hitting the surface being shaded. We might notice that the color of the dark spots is the ambient color, so the direct lighting is what is missing. Direct lighting can be turned off in shadow, so you might hypothesize that these points are incorrectly being tagged as in shadow when they are not. To test this hypothesis, we could turn off the shadowing check and recompile. This would indicate that these are false shadow tests, and we could continue our detective work. The key reason that this method can sometimes be good practice is that we never had to spot a false value or really determine our conceptual error. Instead, we just narrowed in on our conceptual error experimentally. Typically only a few trials are needed to track things down, and this type of debugging is enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Images as Coded Debugging Output</strong></p><p>In many cases, the easiest channel by which to get debugging information out of a graphics program is the output image itself. If you want to know the value of some variable for part of a computation that runs for every pixel, you can just modify your program temporarily to copy that value directly to the output image and skip the rest of the calculations that would normally be done. For instance, if you suspect a problem with surface normals is causing a problem with shading, you can copy the normal vectors directly to the image (x goes to red, y goes to green, z goes to blue), resulting in a color-coded illustration of the vectors actually being used in your computation. Or, if you suspect a particular value is sometimes out of its valid range, make your program write bright red pixels where that happens. Other common tricks include drawing the back sides of surfaces with an obvious color (when they are not supposed to be visible), coloring the image by the ID numbers of the objects, or coloring pixels by the amount of work they took to compute.</p><p><strong>Using a Debugger</strong></p><p>There are still cases, particularly when the scientiﬁc method seems to have led to a contradiction, when there’s no substitute for observing exactly what is going on. The trouble is that graphics programs often involve many, many executions of the same code (once per pixel, for instance, or once per triangle), making it completely impractical to step through in the debugger from the start. And the most difﬁcult bugs usually only occur for complicated inputs.</p><p>A useful approach is to “set a trap” for the bug. First, make sure your program is deterministic—run it in a single thread and make sure that all random numbers are computed from ﬁxed seeds. Then, ﬁnd out which pixel or triangle is exhibiting the bug and add a statement before the code you suspect is incorrect that will be executed only for the suspect case. For instance, if you ﬁnd that pixel (126, 247) exhibits the bug, then add:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>if x=126 and y=247 then
    print &quot;blarg&quot;
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>If you set a breakpoint on the print statement, you can drop into the debugger just before the pixel you’re interested in is computed. Some debuggers have a “conditional breakpoint” feature that can achieve the same thing without modifying the code.</p><p>In the cases where the program crashes, a traditional debugger is useful for pinpointing the site of the crash. You should then start backtracking in the program, using asserts and recompiles, to ﬁnd where the program went wrong. These asserts should be left in the program for potential future bugs you will add. This again means the traditional step-through process is avoided, because that would not be adding the valuable asserts to your program.</p><p><strong>Data Visualization for Debugging</strong></p><p>Often it is hard to understand what your program is doing, because it computes a lot of intermediate results before it ﬁnally goes wrong. The situation is similar to a scientiﬁc experiment that measures a lot of data, and one solution is the same: make good plots and illustrations for yourself to understand what the data means. For instance, in a ray tracer you might write code to visualize ray trees so you can see what paths contributed to a pixel, or in an image resampling routine you might make plots that show all the points where samples are being taken from the input. Time spent writing code to visualize your program’s internal state is also repaid in a better understanding of its behavior when it comes time to optimize it.</p><h2 id="notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Notes</h2><p>The discussion of software engineering is inﬂuenced by the Effective C++ series (Meyers, 1995, 1997), the Extreme Programming movement (Beck &amp; Andres, 2004), and The Practice of Programming (Kernighan &amp; Pike, 1999).
